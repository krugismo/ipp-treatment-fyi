## üß¨ Overview

An evidence-based, open-source treatment calculator and educational resource for **Peyronie's Disease** (Induratio Penis Plastica) multimodal antioxidant therapy. This project compiles extensive research on therapeutic compounds, their synergistic interactions, and personalized dosing protocols based on patient factors and disease stage.

## üéØ Purpose

This project aims to:
- Provide an educational resource for patients and healthcare providers
- Calculate personalized therapeutic dosing based on individual patient factors
- Demonstrate synergistic interactions between treatment components
- Compile and organize scientific literature in an accessible format
- Foster open collaboration in non-surgical treatment approaches

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Pathway Visualization**: Visual representation of oxidative stress cascades and therapeutic interventions
- **Personalized Calculator**: Dosing recommendations based on weight, age, kidney/liver function, and disease stage
- **21 Therapeutic Components**: Comprehensive database of compounds with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties
- **Synergy Analysis**: Documented interactions between treatment components
- **Literature References**: Extensive citation database supporting all therapeutic claims
- **Stage-Specific Protocols**: Tailored approaches for acute, chronic, calcified, and severe presentations
